# Hirter Gewinnspiele

## Description
A contest platform for Hirter beer that removes registration friction by letting customers participate simply by uploading their beer purchase receipts. AI-powered OCR instantly verifies receipts and extracts valuable purchase data, while a multi-contest admin system enables running multiple independent sweepstakes with rich insights into customer behavior.

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: High barrier to entry kills participation
No registration required - customers just upload receipt, provide email/name, and they're entered. Optional fields for address/phone keep it simple.

### Problem 2: Manual receipt verification is slow and error-prone
Instant AI-powered OCR automatically extracts all receipt data (store, date, amount, products) with visual progress feedback and customer verification before submission.

### Problem 3: No insights from customer purchases
Rich data extraction from every receipt reveals where customers shop, what they buy, and when - creating a valuable database for marketing decisions.

### Problem 4: Managing multiple contests is complex
Independent multi-contest system with dedicated admin backend allows running simultaneous sweepstakes with separate participants, rules, and analytics per contest.
